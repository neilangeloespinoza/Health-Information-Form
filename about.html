                <div class="content">
                    <p>online format allows data to be efficiently aggregated while protecting sensitive medical information. Wide participation in the online Health Information Form from PUP's large student body and faculty/staff will boost validity of results across demographics. Key findings will help PUP identify pressing campus health needs in order to improve medical clinic resources, expand health education specific to this population, tailor new wellness programming, and ultimately uphold population health.</p>
